**Task Objectives**

```
This project entails building the same application(Products CRUD) via three different approaches.

Like a very beginner with build the refactor it to a more optimal apporach.


```

**Simple Notes**

```

(a)What is PHP??

Stands for hyper text preprocessor.
Its an open source general-purpose scripting Language.
It is a server side langugae.
It can be embedded into HTML.
It is an interpreted Language.

What is an interpreted Language??

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

**What is PDO**

```
IT Stands for PHP data objects.

It is a lean and consistent way to access the database
and may be used in place of MYSQLI.

Unlike Mysql improved PDO works with mutiple databases.

It provides a data access layer which means that
no matter what database you are using you use same
functions to access data.

It is also completely Object oriented.


Adavantages:

(a)Mutiple database.(You simply change connection string)
when connecting to another database)

(b)Security/Prepared Statements.

This helps prevent your database from SQL injection.

(I.e someone entering queries that may destroy your database through
a form)

Prepared separate the instruction of the SQL statements from the data.

(c)Usability.

(d)Reusability.

(e)Excellent Error handling.(Three ways of handling errors:silent,warning and exception.)

```

**Main PDO Classes**

```
(a)PDO-represents a connection between PHP and DB.

Here we plug in a DSN.

(b)PDO-Statement.

Represents a prepred statement and after execution an
associated results.

(c)PDOException.

Represents errors raised by PDO.

N/B

The main advantage of PDO is mutiple database connection without changing much of the syntax.
